# Description #

Written in VB6.0

This is just a facelift of 4ndronicus' repo, the main purpose of this fork is to now be viewable on smaller screens

It may require the following files to run:
COMDLG32.OCX
MSCOMCTL.OCX
RICHTX32.OCX
MSVBVM60.DLL

This program allows you to:

1) Encrypt text and save it to a text file.
2) Embed text into an image and save the image (with
   text embedded) out to a file.
3) Encrypt text and embed it into an image file and
   save the image (with text embedded) out to a file.

If you can't figure it out, I think an excellent 
career oportunity awaits you in the "Worm Farming"
industry.

I am including a couple of image files.  "None.gif" 
and "Message.bmp".  "None.gif" is a plain GIF with
no message.  "Message.bmp" is a bitmap with an
encrypted message embedded.  The key for decoding
that message is README!!!!!.TXT . Also, take note:
Normal bitmaps and those with embedded text in them
are very nearly the same size.

Please note that you can open gifs, bitmaps, and jpegs.
You can only save out bitmaps!  This may change in 
later versions, but for this one, it didn't.

Test it out and let me know if anything happens that
you think shouldn't happen or doesn't that should.
